Template Processing
---------------------

### Goal

With `glitter` I tried to create a template processor which enables the user to 
create flexible, configurable templates

### ⚠️ Archived ⚠️

This repository is _archived_. All the code should be treated obsolete and unsupported. It is kept as publich archive for certain legacy users.
But I **strongly advise** to take a look at the new, improved, [rust-based glitter](http://github.com/kelko/glitter2)
