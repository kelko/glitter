Template Processing
---------------------

###Goal
With `glitter` I tried to create a template processor which enables the user to 
create flexible, configurable templates

###Heritage
In a certain way `glitter` is the heir of [KAP][]. After creating KAP and using it I realized
I don't need so much a preprocessor as I need a template processor. So the idea for `glitter` was born.

[KAP]: https://github.com/kelko/kap

###Name
Each template consists of up to four parts:

* Global
* Local
* Injection
* Template

The first characters of those parts joined results in "glit" which I expanded to "glitter"
and choose as projects name

###How To
A real How-To/Manual will be written, but the example files in the example-subfolder give
already an impression what `glitter` is able to do.
